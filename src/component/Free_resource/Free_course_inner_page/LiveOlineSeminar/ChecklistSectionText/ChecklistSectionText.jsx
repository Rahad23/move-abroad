                <p className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-950 mt-7 leading-8">The only reason to take the GRE® is to get a good GRE® score.
A good GRE® score is essential for admissions to Master’s and Doctoral programs in many countries, including the U.S.
Many view an admit to a prestigious university as a "VISA to success"—a road map to scaling the highest levels in industry.
The CEOs of Adobe, Google, and Microsoft and thousands of successful professionals, professors, and entrepreneurs attest to this simple strategy of progress in life and career. Thousands of engineers and technologists who made fuel cells, drones, mobile phones, semiconductor factories, software products, and advanced medicines and drugs were all beneficiaries of the powerful selection of higher talent through the GRE® score.
Since the only purpose of taking the GRE® is to get the best possible GRE® score, it is good to understand what really drives and pushes the GRE® score up. In fact, that requires us to understand what GRE® preparation is. Online research and study on GRE® preparation shows that GRE® is a test of skills and abilities in verbal reasoning and quantitative reasoning.
The only way to get a good GRE® score is through good preparation for GRE®.
Since the time of inception of the GRE® in the late 1940s, many test preparation services and classes have sprouted.
In the last few years, online GRE® preparation is becoming the standard way of GRE® preparation. After all, online and mobile learning are anywhere and everywhere, especially in the modern day. Online GRE® preparation, from a good quality provider, can not only track your learning and motivate you, but also continuously improve your GRE® score and reduce the time required for GRE® preparation.
The primary areas of GRE® Verbal and GRE® Quant require graded exercises and tutorials to improve the level of skill. Improved skill results in higher accuracy of solving problems and answering multiple-choice questions. Improved skill also leads to faster rate of answering questions. In the end, good online GRE® preparation enables measurement of both the speed and accuracy of answering and demonstrating GRE® skills. This is one of the biggest advantages of online GRE® preparation compared to any other means.
Many providers simply offer a website or videos or a few pdf files online and try to present themselves as sources of online GRE® preparation. However, not all of them are capable of improving your scores. Very few can teach differently for different students, aptly addressing their individual difficulties and strengths.
A high quality, student-oriented online GRE® preparation will offer you the following:</p>
